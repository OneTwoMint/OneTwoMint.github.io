		<h4>Video Work</h4>
		</div>
	<p>I've mainly worked with Adobe Animate and Adobe Premiere for video work, at least until fairly recently. A short time ago I started using Adobe After Effects for motion graphic work, and I've found myself frankly enamored with the software and the process. I'm eager for more experience in video work, and especially projects involving motion graphics!</p>

		<h4>"Limited Edition" Kinetic Typography</h4>
		</div>
	<p>My first big project with After Effects; An unofficial animated lyric video for the song Limited Edition by HAEL. Everything is kept on the beat thanks to having animated it all in a custom framerate that ensured that every 10 frames was 1 beat, which was then converted to 30 frames per second for viewing comfort. </p>

		<h4>Nintendo Gamecube: A Great Controller Design</h4>
		</div>
	<p>A video essay written, recorded, and edited by myself, mainly through Premiere Pro. The editing work is mainly what's worth highlighting here, between audio correction and timing of footage cuts- This video was made shortly before learning After Effects, and I feel I could use that to improve it a great deal... That project is somewhat low priority for now, though. In the meantime, it's still a fine video.</p>

	<p>A flash animation produced by myself, telling a story meant to serve as the opening to a game. The pace and audio may leave something to be desired, but the animation and pixel art work is still a point of pride for me.</p>
