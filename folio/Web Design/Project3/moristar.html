    <!-- 
    Examining 4 works from Based On A True Story from the perspective of assumed identity, and providing a brief overview of the career of the artists involved.
    Pagewise, I think it'll be best to have a page dedicated to each piece of art and the artist behind it- 
    First, the art, next to/above a description of it depending on layout. Below that, tying the art to the theme. End section. 
    Then, the artist. brief bio, links.
    Finally, gallery of past works.

            <h2>Birth of a Star</h2>
            <p>
                Here, Mariko Mori adopts a computer generated fictional persona, based loosely on a contemporary TV talent show. It comments on the trend of ready-made fame, using artificial personas to sell a pop culture "brand" while also mimicking aspects of japanese pop culture and technology trends. <br> <br> The use of photo manipulation to tweak various parts of her appearance calls to mind the use of digital maipulation in videos and photography today to shape what we see.

    <h2>An Acted Singer in a World of Acted Fame</h2>
    <p class="intro">[Birth of a Star was made in 1995, but the story of a computer generated pop star personality tells a story that feels like a prediction of certain aspects of pop culture now. I imagine an actor playing the part of pop star at the whims of a computer, told by a machine the words to sing and say according to what is most profitable- And I relate that to algorithm driven media on the internet, from click-harvesting news sites to shock-value youtubers to social media influencers selling "the good life."]</p>
