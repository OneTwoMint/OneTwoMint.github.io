    Examining 4 works from Based On A True Story from the perspective of assumed identity, and providing a brief overview of the career of the artists involved.
    Pagewise, I think it'll be best to have a page dedicated to each piece of art and the artist behind it- 
    First, the art, next to/above a description of it depending on layout. Below that, tying the art to the theme. End section. 
    Then, the artist. brief bio, links.
    Finally, gallery of past works.

            <h2>The Bar on East 13th Street</h2>
            <p>Salman Toor recreates Edouard Manet's "Bar at the Folies-Bergiere," a classic piece from 1882 that's generated much critical discussion in its time. The original depicted a moment of eye contact between a barmaid and a patron, a then radical subject to be depicting. <br> <br> Here, that interaction is recreated, from framing to placement of the central figure to the eye contact and social tension. But here, the dynamics are shifted entirely, along with character and setting- Here, it's a scene at a bar for queer people of color, between two men.

    <h2>Telling the Story to Change the Story</h2>
    <p class="intro">Vital to the understanding of this scene is the knowledge that there is a mirror just behind the bar, granting two perspectives on the scene depicted. <br> <br>In Manet's original, the barmaid seems withdrawn, her gaze averted, while the mirror shows that the man she is speaking to is looking at her directly, and to an observer she would seem to be nearly as engaged with him. The barmaid is suggested to be a prostitute, as much a product as the drinks she's selling.
        <br> <br>Here, the roles are shifted somewhat, though the framing and scene is borrowed. Here, the bartender is the one with unaverted eyes, staring calmly and coolly at the individual in front of him- And through the mirror, we see the person the lemon is being offered to. Represented by Salman Toor, the man in the blue suit is now the one with averted gaze, perhaps nervous? He doesn't seem to be withdrawn like the barmaid, especially as a hand is raised to the bartender. But I confess, the precise meaning here eludes me.<br><br>
        Supposedly, the adjacent basket of oranges in Manet's piece are the cue that the barmaid is a prostitute- Here, a citrus takes a more direct role, cut in two and offered to the man in blue. Perhaps the meaning of this exchange is queer sexuality being offered to an interested but nervous individual? In truth, I don't know that I've reached a full understanding of this piece, but it amazes me how the changing of characters has changed the meaning of the same scene and same framing so much.

    <h2>Salman Toor's Life</h2>
    <p class="intro">TEXT TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM WIKIPIEDIA, NOT MY WORK</p>
    <p class="intro">
        Salman Toor was born 1983 in Lahore, Pakistan. Toor came to the United States to attend school at Ohio Wesleyan University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2006. He then obtained his MFA degree from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 2009.
<br><br>
Toor is a part of a loosely-affiliated group of LGBTQ painters, sometimes called the New Queer Intimists, which also includes contemporaries Doron Langberg, Louis Fratino, Kyle Coniglio, Anthony Cudahy, TM Davy, and Devan Shimoyama.
<br><br>
In 2019, Toor was awarded a grant from the Joan Mitchell Foundation.
<br><br>
From 2020 to 2021, Toor's recent paintings were the subject of a solo exhibition, Salman Toor: How Will I Know at the Whitney Museum of American Art. From 2021 to 2022, Toor's painting, Museum Boys (2021) is on view at the Frick Collection; as part of the artist residency and the exhibition, Living Histories: Queer Views and Old Masters where it is placed in a room in conversation with two paintings by Johannes Vermeer, Officer and Laughing Girl (made between 1655 and 1660) and Mistress and Maid (c. 1667).
<br><br>
Toor's work is included in the museum collections at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.
