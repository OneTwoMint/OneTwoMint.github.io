    Pagewise, I think it'll be best to have a page dedicated to each piece of art and the artist behind it- 
    First, the art, next to/above a description of it depending on layout. Below that, tying the art to the theme. End section. 
    Then, the artist. brief bio, links.

            <h2>Small Basement Camera Shop Circa 1937</h2>
            <p>A recreation of an antique photo Rodney Graham found in an antique store. A set like one you might find for a play or movie was constructed meticulously to get every detail as close to the original as possible in every respect. The biggest deviation from the original is that Rodney Graham himself replaces the photo's subject.<br> <br>This piece comments on the nature of photography, using modern equipment and color capability to recreate a photo predating those things, a photo which nonetheless comments on those things.

    <h2>The Reenactor in History</h2>
    <p class="intro">[Is it a self portrait or a portrait of another? The goal is to recreate the photo of the shop, and the role of Rodney Graham here is to represent the clerk in the original photo. As you consider that question, it might merit considering as well: If you take a still frame from a live action movie, do you have a photo of the actor, or of the character they're portraying?</p>

    <h2>Rodney Graham's Work History</h2>
    <p class="intro">TEXT TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM WIKIPIEDIA, NOT MY WORK</p>
    <p class="intro">Coming out of Vancouver's 1970s photoconceptual tradition, Rodney Graham's work is often informed by historical literary, musical, philosophical and popular references. He is most often associated with other West-coast Canadian artists, including Vikky Alexander, Jeff Wall, Stan Douglas, Roy Arden and Ken Lum. He was taught by fellow Vancouver school artist Ian Wallace while at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia, from 1979 to 1980. Around this time, he played electric guitar in the band UJ3RK5 with fellow artist Jeff Wall on keyboards and Ian Wallace on electric bass, among others. His wide-ranging and often genre-busting work has frequently engaged with technologies of the past: literary, psychological and musical texts, optical devices, and film as an historical medium.
<br><br>
        Among his earliest works is Camera Obscura (1979; destroyed 1981) a site-specific work that consisted of a shed-sized optical device on his family's farm field near Abbotsford, British Columbia. Entering the shed, the observer was confronted with an inverted image of a solitary tree. Both prior to this (with Rome Ruins [1978]) and throughout the 1980s and 90s, Graham employed the technique of the camera obscura in his work.
        <br><br>
        Beginning in the early 1980s, Graham took found texts as the basis for his bookworks—at once conceptual and material—inserting bookmarks with additional pages, inserting textual loops or incorporating books into optical devices in works such as Dr. No* (1991), Lenz (1983) and Reading Machine for Lenz (1993) respectively. Many of these were carried out with esteemed Belgian publisher Yves Gevaert and/or the gallerist Christine Burgin. His extensive body of work related to Sigmund Freud (beginning in 1983) has developed out of this text-based practice, though, later, found object books would be integrated unmodified into Donald Judd-like sculptures, for example The Basic Writings of Sigmund Freud (1987).
        <br><br>
        Until 1997, when he represented Canada at the Venice Biennale with the film loop Vexation Island, Graham was most well known for his series of photographs of Welsh oaks seen upside-down. For this project, he employed a photographer to take black and white negatives of majestic, isolated trees in the English countryside with a large-format camera. He then hung the pictures upside down, like camera obscura images. In 1998 Graham produced his definitive work on this theme, a series of seven monumental images of Welsh oaks printed on color paper to produce warm deep sepia and charcoal hues. </p>
