    <!-- 
    Examining 4 works from Based On A True Story from the perspective of assumed identity, and providing a brief overview of the career of the artists involved.
    Pagewise, I think it'll be best to have a page dedicated to each piece of art and the artist behind it- 
    First, the art, next to/above a description of it depending on layout. Below that, tying the art to the theme. End section. 
    Then, the artist. brief bio, links.
    Finally, gallery of past works.

        <!-- Navigation system. Another logo centered top bar like the game site, but without fancy tricks. Unique colors for each button?
        regular: b b logo b b
        smaller: b/b logo b/b
        mobile: logo/b/b/b/b
        should be doable with grid stuff... In a roundabout way.
        Regardless of the rest, home button exists as a separate button below the rest.

    <h2>Becoming Characters, Assuming Identities</h2>
    <p class="intro">[Intro, talk about Based On A True Story and trying to come up with a theme to connect four of the pieces I really liked. In each, a person or place becomes a character, a part of a fiction. Rather than being 
        about the changing of identities, the goal is to use an assumed identity to examine a fiction. This site is meant to talk about these works from this perspective, and talk about who these artists are.]</p>
