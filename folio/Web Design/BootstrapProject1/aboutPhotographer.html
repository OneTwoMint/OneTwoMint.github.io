		<h1 class="brand">About The Photographer</h1>
		<p>CamOp is a professional ghost photographer with a luxury few can claim to have- She was literally made for the job she loves. Photography fascinates her, whether it's got ghosts in it or not, and  you can see some of her hobby work on <a>her blog.</a> She'd describe herself as easygoing and "bearing a light humor," and warns that she is an unstoppable optimist.</p>
		<p>You may have noticed from the picture included at the top of the page that CamOp is a robot. She was made to be a tool for a certain ghost hunting corporation that she elects not to name, and after developing sentience, found herself unable to reconcile her work with her morality. To her, ghosts are the remnants of thinking, feeling beings, and deserve to be treated humanely. Ghost photography can be used to track down the location of ghosts for extermination, but also to diagnose why they're clinging to life, and CamOp is especially qualified to use ghost photography for precisely that, and has connections to others who can help provide humane solutions to your hauntings once the cause can be diagnosed.</p>
		<p>Being a robot affords certain advantages- She's resilient to the sorts of damage a poltergeist can cause, and capable of high speed data analysis to let her provide solutions within a few hours of arriving on the scene. Plus, if you're alright waiting for shipping times, she can mail herself to you, saving both you and her lots on travel costs!</p>
