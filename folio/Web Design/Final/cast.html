        <div id = "cast">
        <h3 class = "name">Tag</h3>
        <p>A robot running on the "Hash Operating System," all for a pun on hashtags. All the robots in Cave Story are named after a punctuation mark, and Tag continues that tradition.</p>
        <p>Tag is a fairly passive individual who is presently willing to go along with whatever happens to be happening. Still, a powerful curiosity is present with the potential to drive him in interesting directions. And of course there is his mysterious "mission" to terminate some kind of crown.</p>

        <img class = "castimg" src = "Rose.png" alt = "Rose">
        <div id = "cast">
        <h3 class = "name">Rose</h3>
        <p>A young witch with a passion for exploration, with rose-red hair.</p>
        <p>Rose is driven to see the world and what it has to offer, and believes Tag is her ticket to make that happen. And so, they're traveling companions for the time being. She has rather unique magic at her command, such as the ability to change the destination of a door as long as there are two somewhat similar door-frames. She also has a fascination with the color green.</p>

        <img class = "castimg" src = "Pawn.png" alt = "Pawn">
        <div id = "cast">
        <h3 class = "name">Pawn</h3>
        <p>A Mimiga bursting with energy who wants to meet new people.</p>
        <p>The pages here don't get into it much, but he's spent his whole life waiting for a prophecy he was told to come true. From a young age he knew he was destined to go on an adventure and try to help a "prototype" and a "flower" on a quest to save the world, and he's managed to turn out surprisingly humble with that in mind. Still, one has to imagine it's been unique to grow up in an isolated village, just waiting for a special day to finally come. </p>
