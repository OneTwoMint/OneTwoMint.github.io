       <p>Me! I'm a nonbinary demigirl, and my pronouns are she/her or they/them. If those words are strange to you, don't worry about it, just talk about me like you would talk about any woman and you'll be doing fine. I like video games mainly, like Sonic the Hedgehog, Hollow Knight, Metroid, and of course, Cave Story, the game Cave Tale is based on.</p>
        <p>I've always wanted to make comics, and still do of course, though I don't currently have any comic-making projects as I'm just trying to get by through college. I was born in Minnesota somewhere, though I couldn't tell you anything about it as I mainly grew up in State College, Pennsylvania. It's a nice college town, and surprisingly urban for a place surrounded on all sides by 3 hours of farmland to drive through. I lived in Provo, Utah for a few years, (an experience I wouldn't recommend,) and now live in Chicago, Illinois. I like Chicago. Tall buildings get me excited, and there's plenty here. </p>
